            <h3>Idyllic beaches</h3>
            <p>
              The unending list of stunning beaches is probably the most obvious reason to visit this tropical paradise in the Indonesian archipelago. Each beach has its own charm, from soft white sand and limestone cliffs to extreme water
              sports and diving. From the mainstream Kuta and luxurious Nusa Dua neighbourhoods to hidden, remote beaches away from the crowds, there’s a beach for everyone, every need and every mood.

            <h3>Captivating cultural scene</h3>
            <p>
              Bali’s beauty goes way deeper than its beautiful appearances. The island is also home to many traditional cultural traditions that are still practiced. The Balinese hold many ceremonies and celebrations throughout the year,
              lots of which can be enjoyed by curious tourists, from the Omed-Omedan kissing festival to the monster parade before the day of silence (Nyepi). Tourists can also enjoy Bali’s culture through music, dance and architecture.

            <h3>Lively religious scene</h3>
            <p>
              The Balinese are spiritual people, predominantly Hindus, and their houses are furnished with a small temple, at which they pray every day. Temple tours are particularly popular among tourists, not only for the religious value
              but also for cultural insights and aesthetic pleasure. From majestic sea temples overlooking the ocean to a soul-soothing grand temple complex up on the mountain, Bali’s temples shouldn’t be missed.
